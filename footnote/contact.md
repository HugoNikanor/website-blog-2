#Contact

There are many ways to contact me, and most of them serve different purposes.

All regular blog entries should have a comment field where you are more than welcome to write your thoughts. I do however reserve the full right to moderate the comments, and remove comments of an unacceptable nature (you are however free to disagree with me).

I have an email address for other general contact at  <hugo.hornquist@gmail.com>.

A Twitter account is also present for twittery stuff. [@hugonikanor](//twitter.com/hugonikanor)  

Feel free to contact me in another way if you find out how, I can't however guarantee that I will answer your queries regardless of communications method.
