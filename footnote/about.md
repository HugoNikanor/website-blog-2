#About

This is a blog and website written and maintained by Hugo Hornquist (me).

I will primarily post computer related information, and mostly in Swedish.
Some entries might however be written in English to allow for a temporary larger audience.  
The about pages are written in English for that reason (Hello! Non Swedes!).

A (hopefully) up to date version of the source code for the website is available [here](//github.com/HugoNikanor/website-blog). However, be aware that any blog entries, the four files in the bottom bar as well as some other parts of the website are not included in that repository.
